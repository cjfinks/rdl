--CAPTION--
Provided the signal-noise ratio is large enough, the maximum column-wise difference between the learned dictionary and the generating dictionary grows linearly with the noise once the columns of the learned dictionary are properly re-ordered and scaled. The figure was generated as follows. First, a random (n x n) dictionary $A$ and $N = m[(k-1)mCk+1]$ random $k$-sparse vectors $\mathbf{a}_i$ were drawn by independently sampling their non-zero coefficients from a uniform distribution over [-1,1], with an equal number of $k$-sparse vectors being supported on each length-$k$ interval in $[m]$. Then, a noisy dataset $\mathbf{y}_i = A\mathbf{a}_i + \mathbf{n}_i$ was generated for each value of $\varepsilon$ by drawing $\mathbf{n}_i$ from a uniform distribution over the $\varepsilon$-sphere. For each of these datasets, we ran FastICA until convergence to a dictionary $B$ and sources $\mathbf{b}_i$ and then thresholded each source to be $k$-sparse by setting all but their $k$ largest absolute cofficients to zero. To each such matrix $B$ a corresponding permutation-scaling matrix $PD$ was attributed, estimated to be the matrix obtained by setting all but the largest element in every column of $B^{-1}A$ to 0 (a check was performed to confirm that every row of PD had only one nonzero element as well). The plot shows, for each value of $\varepsilon$, the maximum value of $\max_i |(A-BPD)_i|_2$ over all dictionaries $B$ and corresponding $k$-sparse sources $\mathbf{b}_i$ obtained by this procedure which satisfied $|\mathbf{y}_i - B\mathbf{b}_i|_2 \leq \varepsilon$.
